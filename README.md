## My process

During the process of creating this project,
- I setup HTML layout
- I style the HTML with CSS to make my project look beautiful
- I got the player's hand choice using an event listener
- I got the Computer's Choice by defining an array and randomly selecting the elements of the array 
- I wrote a fuction to compare both choices and assign score
- I wrote a function to update the DOM 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Arrow Functions
- Arrays
- loops
- Events
- Conditional Statements
- DOM manipulation
- Objects


### What I learned

During the process of creating this project, i learnt a lot of things like:
- Randomly selecting an element from an array
- forEach Loop
- Javascript DOM manipulation
- JS modal pop up
- JS Timing   
- Objects

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Areas i would like to focus on in the future:
- Promises
- Constructors
- DOM manipulation
- Arrow Functions
- Loops
- Objects

### Useful resources
